# 🎯 Lead Score Case Study | Predicting Lead Conversion with Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify potential leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The goal is to help the business optimize its sales efforts by assigning a conversion score to each lead.

The analysis includes a complete end-to-end approach — from cleaning and preprocessing raw CRM data to building and evaluating a logistic regression model.
